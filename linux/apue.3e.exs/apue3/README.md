# Solutions: Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment v3
This repository contains my solutions to the exercises in _Advanced Programming
in the Unix Environment v3_.  I've tried to make each solution file
self-sufficient; I do not use the "apue.h" header.  When an exercise depends on
pre-written functions, I copy the implementation of those functions into the
solution source file.
